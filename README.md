# Code samples for talk [PHP Generics Today (Almost)](https://www.daveliddament.co.uk/talks/php-generics-today-almost/)

Here are the full code samples for all code shown in the slides.

The first two snippets (`01_TypedQueue.php` and `02_UserQueue.php`) show how to get generic like behaviour in PHP.

The remaining snippets show how to annotate code with generics like behaviour so static analysers can find problems.
Where there are two version the `a_` version shows a bug and the `b_` version shows the fix.

Try these snippets out on the static analysers online playgrounds, they are found at:

- [Psalm](https://psalm.dev)
- [PHPStan](https://phpstan.org/)


NOTE: There are 2 examples where PHPStan and Psalm disagree. I think Psalm is right, what do you think?
